1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,886
According to all known laws
of aviation,

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,690
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

3
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:34,462
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

4
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,968
The bee, of course, flies anyway

5
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,201
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

6
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,660
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

7
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,856
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

8
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,577
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

9
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,976
Ooming!

10
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,641
Hang on a second.

11
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,672
Hello?

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,843
- Barry?
- Adam?

13
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,480
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,823
Looking sharp.

15
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,594
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

16
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,032
Sorry. I'm excited.

17
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,094
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

18
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:47,605
A perfect report card, all B's.

19
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,936
Very proud.

20
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,873
Ma! I got a thing going here.

21
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,606
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,116
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

23
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,743
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

24
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,471
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

25
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,944
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

26
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,412
Never thought I'd make it.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,972
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

28
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,244
Those were awkward.

29
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,482
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

30
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,319
You did come back different.

31
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,055
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,759
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,698
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

34
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,962
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

35
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,630
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

36
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,230
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

37
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,378
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

38
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,716
That's why we don't need vacations.

39
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,691
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

40
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,632
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

41
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,137
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

42
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,537
Hallelujah!

43
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,473
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,536
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

45
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,843
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

46
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,214
...9:15.

47
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,183
That concludes our ceremonies.

48
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:51,093
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

49
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,722
Will we pick ourjob today?

50
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,664
I heard it's just orientation.

51
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,725
Heads up! Here we go.

52
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:01,573
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,408
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

54
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,018
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

55
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,924
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

56
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,427
This is it!

57
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:25,991
Wow.

58
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,197
Wow.

59
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,207
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,575
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

61
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:44,276
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

62
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,113
Our top-secret formula

63
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:50,383
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

64
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,050
into this soothing sweet syrup

65
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,062
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,291
Honey!

67
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,068
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

68
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,332
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

69
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:10,137
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

70
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,337
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

71
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:17,008
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

72
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,590
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

73
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,195
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

74
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,503
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

75
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,772
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

76
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,339
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

77
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,443
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

78
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,251
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

79
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,224
But choose carefully

80
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:04,992
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

81
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,126
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

82
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,931
What's the difference?

83
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:16,364
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

84
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,933
in 27 million years.

85
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,713
So you'll just work us to death?

86
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,009
We'll sure try.

87
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,959
Wow! That blew my mind!

88
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,829
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

89
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,240
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

90
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,643
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

91
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,740
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

92
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,308
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

93
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,378
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

94
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,986
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

95
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,052
Like what? Give me one example.

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,262
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

97
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,767
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

98
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,708
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

99
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,076
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

100
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,784
I've never seen them this close.

101
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,193
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

102
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,026
Yeah, but some don't come back.

103
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,690
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

104
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,816
You guys did great!

105
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:17,329
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

106
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,830
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

107
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,332
Their day's not planned.

108
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,927
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

109
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,997
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

110
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,739
Right.

111
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,612
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

112
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,173
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

113
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:44,952
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

114
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,686
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

115
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,421
Distant. Distant.

116
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,827
Look at these two.

117
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,867
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

118
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,266
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

119
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,362
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

120
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:04,068
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

121
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,634
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

122
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,646
What were you doing during this?

123
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,443
Trying to alert the authorities.

124
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,211
I can autograph that.

125
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,220
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

126
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,550
Yeah. Gusty.

127
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,080
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

128
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,683
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

129
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,197
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

130
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,198
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

131
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,860
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

132
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,531
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

133
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,004
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

134
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,785
Hey, Honex!

135
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,119
Dad, you surprised me.

136
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,455
You decide what you're interested in?

137
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,690
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

138
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,127
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,191
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

140
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,137
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

141
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,573
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

142
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,975
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

143
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,446
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

144
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,279
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

145
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,752
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

146
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,052
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

147
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,117
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

148
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,687
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

149
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,666
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

150
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,464
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

151
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,630
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

152
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,731
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

153
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,902
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

154
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,347
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

155
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,815
I'm so proud.

156
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,585
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

157
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,822
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

158
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,261
Yeah, right.

159
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:10,132
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

160
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,296
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

161
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,273
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

162
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,434
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

163
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,672
Wow!

164
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,111
Oouple of newbies?

165
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,615
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

166
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,912
Make your choice.

167
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,284
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

168
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,119
Oh, my. What's available?

169
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,160
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

170
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:39,163
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

171
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

172
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,259
Wax monkey's always open.

173
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,401
The Krelman opened up again.

174
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,462
What happened?

175
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,136
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

176
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,042
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

177
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,480
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

178
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,711
Oh, this is so hard!

179
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,054
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

180
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:07,354
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

181
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,827
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

182
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,561
Barry!

183
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,199
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

184
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,100
What happened to you?
Where are you?

185
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,537
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

186
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,199
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

187
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,971
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

188
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,536
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

189
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,275
Another call coming in.

190
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,046
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

191
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,555
that gets their roses today.

192
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,783
Hey, guys.

193
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,055
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

194
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,392
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

195
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,556
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

196
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,532
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

197
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,070
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

198
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,662
- Thank you.
- OK.

199
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,570
You got a rain advisory today,

200
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,702
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

201
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,407
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

202
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,140
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

203
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,086
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

204
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,820
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

205
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,858
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

206
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,923
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

207
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,162
All right, launch positions!

208
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:30,172
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

209
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,935
Black and yellow!

210
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,172
Hello!

211
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,481
You ready for this, hot shot?

212
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,381
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

213
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,941
Wind, check.

214
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,045
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

215
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,613
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

216
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,659
Scared out of my shorts, check.

217
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,785
OK, ladies,

218
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,693
let's move it out!

219
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:05,040
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

220
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:09,643
All of you, drain those flowers!

221
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,399
Wow! I'm out!

222
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,062
I can't believe I'm out!

223
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,399
So blue.

224
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,912
I feel so fast and free!

225
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,748
Box kite!

226
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,412
Wow!

227
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,761
Flowers!

228
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,310
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

229
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,405
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

230
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,506
Roses!

231
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,381
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

232
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,561
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

233
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,569
That is one nectar collector!

234
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,773
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

235
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:51,642
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

236
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,016
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

237
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,812
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

238
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,725
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

239
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,921
Oool.

240
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,246
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

241
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,583
Oopy that visual.

242
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,319
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

243
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,918
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

244
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,493
Affirmative.

245
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,606
That was on the line!

246
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,270
This is the coolest. What is it?

247
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,939
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

248
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,111
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

249
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,777
Yeah, fuzzy.

250
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,617
Ohemical-y.

251
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,850
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

252
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,119
My sweet lord of bees!

253
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,185
Oandy-brain, get off there!

254
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,020
Problem!

255
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,702
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

256
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,964
Affirmative.

257
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,869
Very close.

258
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,205
Gonna hurt.

259
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,570
Mama's little boy.

260
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,544
You are way out of position, rookie!

261
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,881
Ooming in at you like a missile!

262
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,451
Help me!

263
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,723
I don't think these are flowers.

264
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,319
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

265
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,727
What is this?!

266
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,834
Match point!

267
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:56,898
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

268
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,915
Yowser!

269
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:36,741
Gross.

270
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,454
There's a bee in the car!

271
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,018
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

272
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,924
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

273
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,724
He's going to sting me!

274
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,234
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

275
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,743
He blinked!

276
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,836
Spray him, Granny!

277
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,403
What are you doing?!

278
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,152
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

279
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,484
I gotta get home.

280
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,931
Oan't fly in rain.

281
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,011
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

282
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,626
Ken, could you close
the window please?

283
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,357
Oheck out my new résumé.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

284
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,228
You see? Folds out.

285
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,700
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

286
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,369
What was that?

287
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,035
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

288
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,072
Drapes!

289
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,137
That is diabolical.

290
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:21,152
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

291
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,085
What's number one? Star Wars?

292
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,622
Nah, I don't go for that...

293
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,889
...kind of stuff.

294
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,895
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

295
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,195
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

296
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,395
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

297
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,964
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

298
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,175
I predicted global warming.

299
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,082
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

300
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,415
Wait! Stop! Bee!

301
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,325
Stand back. These are winter boots.

302
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,186
Wait!

303
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,792
Don't kill him!

304
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,926
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

305
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,767
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

306
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:19,370
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

307
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:24,438
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

308
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,941
My brochure!

309
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,128
There you go, little guy.

310
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,038
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

311
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:53,577
Put that on your résumé brochure.

312
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,579
My whole face could puff up.

313
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,638
Make it one of your special skills.

314
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,049
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

315
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,756
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

316
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,419
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

317
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,655
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

318
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,994
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

319
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,963
I gotta say something.

320
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,732
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

321
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,741
All right, here it goes.

322
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,852
Nah.

323
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,198
What would I say?

324
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,032
I could really get in trouble.

325
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,308
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

326
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,210
I can't believe I'm doing this.

327
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,371
I've got to.

328
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:06,713
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

329
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,649
No. Yes. No.

330
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,712
Do it. I can't.

331
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,285
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

332
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,489
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

333
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,327
Hi!

334
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,992
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,502
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

336
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,832
You're talking!

337
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,236
I'm so sorry.

338
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,503
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

339
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,703
But I don't recall going to bed.

340
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,873
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

341
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:41,749
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

342
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,381
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

343
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,516
but they were all trying to kill me.

344
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,924
And if it wasn't for you...

345
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,395
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

346
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,661
That was a little weird.

347
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,726
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

348
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,570
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

349
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,439
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

350
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,843
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

351
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,382
The talking thing.

352
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,716
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey. " You pick it up.

353
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,220
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

354
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,589
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

355
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,718
Anyway...

356
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,091
Oan I...

357
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,594
...get you something?
- Like what?

358
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:31,068
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

359
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,468
I don't want to put you out.

360
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,802
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

361
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,933
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

362
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,069
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

363
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,443
Hey, you want rum cake?

364
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,947
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

365
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:46,279
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

366
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:48,546
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

367
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,451
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

368
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,614
You look great!

369
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,386
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

370
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:55,682
Are you all right?

371
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,525
No.

372
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:03,395
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

373
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,402
He finally gets there.

374
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,133
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

375
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:13,303
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

376
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,608
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

377
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,017
Is that a bee joke?

378
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,613
That's the kind of stuff we do.

379
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,658
Yeah, different.

380
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,752
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

381
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,820
About work? I don't know.

382
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:37,358
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

383
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,766
I know how you feel.

384
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,771
- You do?
- Sure.

385
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,299
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

386
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,175
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

387
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,909
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

388
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,513
Anyway, if you look...

389
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,351
There's my hive right there. See it?

390
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,118
You're in Sheep Meadow!

391
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,853
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

392
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:07,695
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

393
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,599
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

394
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,127
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

395
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,936
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

396
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,239
Just having two cups of coffee!

397
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,117
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

398
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,388
Yeah, it's no trouble.

399
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,296
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

400
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,960
Are you?

401
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,669
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

402
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,764
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

403
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,172
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

404
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,544
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

405
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,106
Or not.

406
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,078
OK, Barry.

407
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,144
And thank you
so much again... for before.

408
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,190
Oh, that? That was nothing.

409
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:08,987
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

410
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,046
This can't possibly work.

411
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,711
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

412
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,050
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

413
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,323
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

414
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,329
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

415
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,991
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

416
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,660
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

417
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,896
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

418
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:55,735
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

419
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,641
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

420
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,269
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

421
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:05,510
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

422
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:10,020
You had your "experience. " Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

423
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,749
- Well...
- Well?

424
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,120
Well, I met someone.

425
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,523
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

426
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,858
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

427
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,262
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

428
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,529
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

429
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:25,933
I can't get by that face.

430
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,629
So who is she?

431
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,767
She's... human.

432
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,711
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

433
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,881
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

434
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,884
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

435
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,716
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

436
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,320
We're not dating.

437
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,451
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

438
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,156
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

439
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:57,224
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

440
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,462
This is over!

441
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,026
Eat this.

442
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,801
This is not over! What was that?

443
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,342
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

444
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,902
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

445
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,914
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

446
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:14,349
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

447
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,477
Sit down!

448
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,487
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

449
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:21,582
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

450
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,924
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

451
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,760
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

452
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:32,098
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

453
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,933
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

454
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:38,374
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

455
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,106
There he is. He's in the pool.

456
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,580
You know what your problem is, Barry?

457
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,674
I gotta start thinking bee?

458
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,685
How much longer will this go on?

459
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,745
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

460
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,587
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

461
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:58,891
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

462
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,397
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

463
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,333
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

464
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,267
Martin, would you talk to him?

465
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,032
Barry, I'm talking to you!

466
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,826
You coming?

467
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,733
Got everything?

468
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,902
All set!

469
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,304
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

470
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,966
Don't be too long.

471
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,752
Watch this!

472
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,765
Vanessa!

473
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,373
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

474
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,538
He doesn't respond to yelling!

475
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,775
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

476
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,476
I'm not listening to this.

477
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,711
Sorry, I've gotta go.

478
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,219
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

479
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,018
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

480
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,183
Bye.

481
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,523
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

482
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:43,966
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

483
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,563
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

484
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,077
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

485
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,545
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

486
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:01,418
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

487
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,751
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

488
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:07,586
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

489
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,095
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

490
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,823
You don't have that?

491
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,833
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

492
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,232
Oh, my.

493
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,427
Dumb bees!

494
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,736
You must want to sting all those jerks.

495
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,868
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

496
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,436
So you have to watch your temper.

497
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,847
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

498
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,853
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

499
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:40,482
Anger, jealousy, lust.

500
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,725
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

501
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,023
Yeah.

502
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,394
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

503
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,902
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

504
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,200
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

505
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,570
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

506
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,543
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

507
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,704
You've really got that
down to a science.

508
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,772
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

509
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:09,377
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

510
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:12,821
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

511
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,825
Ray Liotta Private Select?

512
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,760
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

513
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,663
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

514
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,826
You don't have
enough food of your own?

515
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,495
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

516
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,404
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

517
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,339
And it's hard to make it!

518
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,175
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

519
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,544
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

520
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,946
It's just honey, Barry.

521
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,609
Just what?!

522
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,348
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

523
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,358
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

524
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,060
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

525
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,360
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

526
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,529
Hey, Hector.

527
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,041
- You almost done?
- Almost.

528
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,610
He is here. I sense it.

529
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,659
Well, I guess I'll go home now

530
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,993
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

531
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,896
You're busted, box boy!

532
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,563
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

533
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,504
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

534
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,667
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

535
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,337
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

536
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,074
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

537
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,176
You're too late! It's ours now!

538
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,845
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

539
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,254
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

540
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,417
Where is the honey coming from?

541
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,956
Tell me where!

542
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,555
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

543
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,215
Orazy person!

544
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,590
What horrible thing has happened here?

545
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,063
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

546
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,862
they're on the road to nowhere!

547
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,664
Just keep still.

548
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,261
What? You're not dead?

549
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,407
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

550
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,502
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

551
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,948
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

552
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,951
I'm going to Tacoma.

553
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,112
- And you?
- He really is dead.

554
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,450
All right.

555
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,716
Uh-oh!

556
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,758
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

557
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,816
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

558
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,556
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

559
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,896
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

560
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,129
How much do you people need to see?!

561
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,264
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

562
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,537
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

563
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,170
But don't kill no more bugs!

564
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:00,006
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!

565
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,790
- You hear something?
- Like what?

566
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,192
Like tiny screaming.

567
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,761
Turn off the radio.

568
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,568
Whassup, bee boy?

569
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,374
Hey, Blood.

570
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:32,644
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

571
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,911
Wow!

572
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:37,648
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

573
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,155
I mean, that honey's ours.

574
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,487
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

575
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,151
It's a close community.

576
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:47,220
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

577
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,825
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

578
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,337
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

579
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:57,374
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

580
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:01,707
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

581
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,906
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

582
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,574
You got to be kidding me!

583
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,053
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

584
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,950
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

585
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,627
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

586
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,907
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

587
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,506
What is this place?

588
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,983
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

589
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,543
They are pinheads!

590
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,153
Pinhead.

591
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,351
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

592
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,020
The Thomas 3000!

593
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,120
Smoker?

594
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:58,100
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

595
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,170
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

596
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,176
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

597
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,770
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

598
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,792
Oh, my!

599
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,700
What's going on? Are you OK?

600
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,005
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

601
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:43,979
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

602
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,414
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

603
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,181
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

604
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,222
That's a drag queen!

605
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,558
What is this?

606
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,532
Oh, no!

607
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,233
There's hundreds of them!

608
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,412
Bee honey.

609
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:26,855
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

610
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,122
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

611
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,287
Oh, Barry, stop.

612
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,457
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

613
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,524
Do these look like rumors?

614
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,264
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

615
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,533
How did you get mixed up in this?

616
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,131
He's been talking to humans.

617
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,938
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

618
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,878
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

619
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,471
Make out? Barry!

620
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:52,709
We do not.

621
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,978
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

622
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,280
The bees!

623
00:40:56,353 --> 00:41:01,154
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

624
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,955
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

625
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:07,759
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

626
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,323
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

627
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:13,461
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

628
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,061
I remember that.

629
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,573
What right do they have to our honey?

630
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,634
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

631
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,408
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

632
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,245
Sting them where it really hurts.

633
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,579
In the face! The eye!

634
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,879
- That would hurt.
- No.

635
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,682
Up the nose? That's a killer.

636
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:35,384
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

637
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:40,328
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

638
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,329
No more bee beards!

639
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,334
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

640
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,336
Weather with Storm Stinger.

641
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:54,942
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

642
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,170
And Jeanette Ohung.

643
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,478
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

644
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,953
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

645
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,617
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

646
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,422
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

647
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,027
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

648
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:21,765
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

649
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,297
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

650
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,537
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

651
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:31,047
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

652
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,709
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

653
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,049
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

654
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,646
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

655
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,817
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

656
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,258
How old are you?

657
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,661
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

658
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,564
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

659
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,660
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

660
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,069
It's a common name. Next week...

661
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:01,071
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

662
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,669
Next week...

663
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,080
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

664
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:11,178
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

665
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:16,352
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

666
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:22,456
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

667
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,367
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

668
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,100
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

669
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,870
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

670
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,208
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

671
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,942
I'm helping him sue the human race.

672
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,215
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

673
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,548
This is Ken.

674
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:48,718
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

675
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,124
Why does he talk again?

676
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,130
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

677
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,393
But it's our yogurt night!

678
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,798
Bye-bye.

679
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,404
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

680
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,341
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

681
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,640
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

682
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,179
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

683
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,479
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

684
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,952
So why are you helping me?

685
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,887
Bees have good qualities.

686
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:23,753
And it takes my mind off the shop.

687
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:27,957
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

688
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,432
Those are great, if you're three.

689
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,059
And artificial flowers.

690
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:36,095
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

691
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,573
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

692
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,769
Bees must hate those fake things!

693
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,404
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

694
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,643
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

695
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:49,584
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

696
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,951
You sure you want to go through with it?

697
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,923
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

698
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,688
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

699
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,861
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

700
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:08,166
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

701
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:13,198
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

702
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,906
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

703
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,814
It's pretty big, isn't it?

704
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,979
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

705
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:29,287
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

706
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,052
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

707
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,903
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

708
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,247
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

709
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,346
You boys work on this?

710
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:06,022
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

711
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,724
All right. Oase number 4475,

712
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:13,202
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry

713
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,999
is now in session.

714
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:19,668
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

715
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,540
A privilege.

716
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:26,948
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

717
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,764
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

718
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:46,435
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

719
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,566
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

720
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,736
my grandmother was a simple woman.

721
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,509
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

722
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:03,645
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

723
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,816
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

724
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,654
just think of what would it mean.

725
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,923
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

726
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,261
for the elastic in my britches!

727
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,426
Talking bee!

728
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,993
How do we know this isn't some sort of

729
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,598
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

730
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,439
They could be using laser beams!

731
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,005
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

732
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,676
he could be on steroids!

733
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,181
Mr. Benson?

734
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,890
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

735
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:50,695
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

736
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,565
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

737
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:56,800
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

738
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,604
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

739
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,473
who think they can take it from us

740
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,675
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

741
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:10,311
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

742
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,218
but everything we are!

743
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,956
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

744
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,758
Oall your first witness.

745
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,598
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

746
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,000
I suppose so.

747
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,836
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

748
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,741
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

749
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:37,337
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

750
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:41,350
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

751
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,352
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

752
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,751
- No.
- No.

753
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:48,484
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

754
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:53,427
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

755
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,022
They're very lovable creatures.

756
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,626
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

757
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,034
You mean like this?

758
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,606
Bears kill bees!

759
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,371
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

760
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,507
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

761
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,280
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

762
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:26,592
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

763
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:30,656
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

764
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,396
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

765
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,732
No, I haven't.

766
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,332
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

767
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,740
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

768
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,575
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

769
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,909
Oh, please.

770
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,143
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

771
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:50,084
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

772
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:54,647
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

773
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,890
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

774
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:03,029
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

775
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,399
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

776
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,335
Thank you. Thank you.

777
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,635
I see from your résumé
that you're devilishly handsome

778
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,906
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

779
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,447
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

780
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,780
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

781
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,286
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

782
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,120
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

783
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,716
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

784
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:33,922
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

785
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,631
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

786
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,398
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

787
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,597
Order! Order, I say!

788
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,270
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

789
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,279
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

790
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:56,876
I think the jury's on our side.

791
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,947
Are we doing everything right, legally?

792
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:01,183
I'm a florist.

793
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:04,819
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

794
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,226
To a great team!

795
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,862
Well, hello.

796
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,901
- Ken!
- Hello.

797
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,027
I didn't think you were coming.

798
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:19,167
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

799
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:23,508
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

800
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,579
Oh, that was lucky.

801
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,717
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

802
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,086
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

803
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,791
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

804
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:44,425
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

805
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:50,262
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

806
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,207
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé,

807
00:51:55,278 --> 00:52:00,545
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

808
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,552
You think I don't see what you're doing?

809
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,283
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

810
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,524
Do we?

811
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:13,996
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

812
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,897
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

813
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,961
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

814
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,336
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

815
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,140
Yeah, you do that.

816
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,144
Look at that.

817
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,259
You know, I've just about had it

818
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,265
with your little mind games.

819
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,858
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

820
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,597
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

821
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,138
A lot of ads.

822
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:59,471
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

823
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:03,070
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

824
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,881
I think something stinks in here!

825
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,440
I love the smell of flowers.

826
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,453
How do you like the smell of flames?!

827
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,579
Not as much.

828
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:30,463
Water bug! Not taking sides!

829
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:36,004
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

830
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,774
I've got issues!

831
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,245
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

832
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,313
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

833
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,368
Surf's up, dude!

834
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:00,425
Poo water!

835
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,002
That bowl is gnarly.

836
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,512
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

837
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,013
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

838
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,518
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

839
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,450
We need to talk!

840
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,454
He's just a little bee!

841
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:24,516
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

842
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:29,861
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

843
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:34,870
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

844
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,873
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

845
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,207
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

846
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,179
Goodbye, Ken.

847
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,775
And for your information,

848
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:55,120
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

849
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,226
I'm sorry about all that.

850
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,958
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

851
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,933
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

852
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,665
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

853
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,570
Are you OK for the trial?

854
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,372
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

855
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:19,176
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

856
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:23,549
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

857
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,180
Yeah.

858
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,582
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

859
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,923
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

860
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:36,364
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

861
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,164
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

862
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,704
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

863
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,605
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

864
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:50,442
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

865
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,949
What exactly is your relationship

866
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,008
to that woman?

867
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,343
We're friends.

868
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,718
- Good friends?
- Yes.

869
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,952
How good? Do you live together?

870
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,493
Wait a minute...

871
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,188
Are you her little...

872
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,027
...bedbug?

873
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,363
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

874
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:16,235
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

875
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,241
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

876
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,174
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

877
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,075
Hold me back!

878
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,671
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

879
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:27,080
He's denouncing bees!

880
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,744
Don't y'all date your cousins?

881
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,549
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

882
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,620
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

883
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,996
Oh, I'm hit!

884
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,161
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

885
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,864
Order! Order!

886
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:52,169
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

887
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,201
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

888
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:00,978
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

889
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:05,612
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

890
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,418
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

891
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,661
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

892
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,527
from my heaving buttocks?

893
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,362
I will have order in this court. Order!

894
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,926
Order, please!

895
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,807
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

896
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,140
took a pointed turn against the bees

897
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:33,876
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

898
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,897
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

899
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,455
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

900
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,600
I...

901
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,966
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

902
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,908
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

903
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,741
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

904
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:08,750
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

905
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,651
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

906
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,316
What was it like to sting someone?

907
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,756
I can't explain it. It was all...

908
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:20,318
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

909
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,660
All right.

910
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,759
You think it was all a trap?

911
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:30,067
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

912
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:34,542
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

913
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,943
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

914
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,275
I don't know.

915
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,784
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

916
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,446
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

917
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,853
Oh, my.

918
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,953
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

919
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,996
- Why?
- The smoke.

920
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,690
Bees don't smoke.

921
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,690
Right. Bees don't smoke.

922
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,635
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

923
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,038
That's it! That's our case!

924
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,940
It is? It's not over?

925
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,979
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

926
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:13,038
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

927
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:20,553
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.

928
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,453
Mr. Flayman.

929
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,395
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

930
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,161
Where is the rest of your team?

931
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,601
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

932
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:37,333
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

933
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,137
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

934
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,005
I actually heard a funny story about...

935
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,513
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

936
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,312
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

937
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:53,287
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

938
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:57,816
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

939
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,830
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

940
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,830
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

941
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,199
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

942
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,671
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

943
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,004
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

944
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,738
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

945
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,940
Show me the smoking gun!

946
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,380
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

947
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,114
Here is your smoking gun.

948
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,414
What is that?

949
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,982
It's a bee smoker!

950
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,052
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

951
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,622
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

952
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,865
Look at what has happened

953
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:50,140
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

954
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,306
Is this what nature intended for us?

955
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,249
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

956
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,752
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

957
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,814
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

958
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,460
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

959
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:13,094
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

960
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,694
Free the bees! Free the bees!

961
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,933
Free the bees!

962
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:20,942
Free the bees! Free the bees!

963
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,946
The court finds in favor of the bees!

964
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,481
Vanessa, we won!

965
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,575
I knew you could do it! High-five!

966
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,379
Sorry.

967
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:34,787
I'm OK! You know what this means?

968
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,348
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

969
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:39,861
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

970
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:47,128
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

971
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,864
You'll regret this.

972
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,132
Barry, how much honey is out there?

973
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,937
All right. One at a time.

974
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,807
Barry, who are you wearing?

975
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,608
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

976
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:01,514
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

977
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:05,714
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

978
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:11,818
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

979
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,625
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

980
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,592
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

981
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,297
every last drop.

982
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:26,671
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

983
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,678
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

984
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,408
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

985
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,849
Wait for my signal.

986
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:37,981
Take him out.

987
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:42,958
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

988
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:46,461
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

989
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,463
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

990
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,864
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

991
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:56,098
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

992
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,935
Oan't breathe.

993
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,672
Bring it in, boys!

994
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,113
Hold it right there! Good.

995
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:10,284
Tap it.

996
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:18,623
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

997
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:22,562
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

998
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,101
Shut down honey production!

999
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,034
Stop making honey!

1000
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,032
Turn your key, sir!

1001
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,986
What do we do now?

1002
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,821
Oannonball!

1003
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,702
We're shutting honey production!

1004
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:03,932
Mission abort.

1005
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,498
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1006
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,025
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1007
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,083
Oh, yeah?

1008
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,891
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1009
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:05,156
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

1010
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,169
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

1011
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,764
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1012
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:13,331
At least we got our honey back.

1013
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,607
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1014
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,548
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

1015
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,848
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

1016
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,255
And now...

1017
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,753
Now I can't.

1018
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:44,873
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

1019
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,375
I thought their lives would be better!

1020
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:51,311
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1021
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,440
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1022
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,179
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

1023
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,485
What happened here?

1024
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,286
That is not the half of it.

1025
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,956
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1026
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,833
They're all wilting.

1027
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,996
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1028
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,403
No.

1029
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,806
And whose fault do you think that is?

1030
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,473
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1031
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:25,741
Bees?

1032
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,749
Specifically, me.

1033
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:32,015
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

1034
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:37,082
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1035
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,026
That's our whole SAT test right there.

1036
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:43,657
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

1037
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,166
And then, of course...

1038
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,997
The human species?

1039
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,264
So if there's no more pollination,

1040
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,139
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1041
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:58,578
I know this is also partly my fault.

1042
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,846
How about a suicide pact?

1043
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,444
How do we do it?

1044
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,514
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.

1045
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:10,923
Right, right.

1046
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:15,861
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1047
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,699
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1048
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,041
Vanessa?

1049
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,975
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1050
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,077
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

1051
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:42,090
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1052
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:45,594
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1053
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:50,121
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1054
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,497
I know. Me neither.

1055
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,400
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1056
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:02,574
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1057
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,569
Roses!

1058
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,078
Vanessa!

1059
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,411
Roses?!

1060
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:10,884
Barry?

1061
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,013
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

1062
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,116
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1063
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,526
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1064
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:24,657
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?

1065
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,325
Oould you slow down?

1066
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,563
Barry!

1067
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:34,131
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1068
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,541
Yes, it kind of is.

1069
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:37,909
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

1070
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,312
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

1071
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,816
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1072
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,819
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1073
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:49,153
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

1074
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,022
I don't want to hear it!

1075
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55,954
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

1076
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,228
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1077
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,896
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1078
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,098
- Bees.
- Park.

1079
01:09:04,173 --> 01:09:05,333
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

1080
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,376
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

1081
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,974
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.

1082
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:15,039
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

1083
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,414
Security will be tight.

1084
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,248
I have an idea.

1085
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,787
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1086
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,517
Official floral business. It's real.

1087
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,991
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1088
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:26,721
Thank you. It was a gift.

1089
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,496
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

1090
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,661
How about The Princess and the Pea?

1091
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,671
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1092
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:38,001
Yes, I got it.

1093
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,106
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

1094
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,043
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

1095
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,774
It goes under the mattresses.

1096
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,612
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

1097
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,676
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1098
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:55,753
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1099
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,454
Hey, what are you doing?!

1100
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,358
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

1101
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:06,026
...without arousing suspicion.

1102
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,639
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1103
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:12,696
Stop! Security.

1104
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,970
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

1105
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,569
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

1106
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:19,944
Would you remove your shoes?

1107
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:22,313
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

1108
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,581
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1109
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:35,561
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1110
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:40,533
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

1111
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,195
I think this is gonna work.

1112
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,363
It's got to work.

1113
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,067
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.

1114
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,439
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

1115
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,206
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

1116
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,273
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

1117
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:57,444
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

1118
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,781
Be careful.

1119
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,948
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1120
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,518
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1121
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,958
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.

1122
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,061
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

1123
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,503
Bee!

1124
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:19,700
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1125
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:26,311
What are you doing?

1126
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:34,079
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

1127
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,953
Don't move.

1128
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:41,585
Oh, Barry.

1129
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,463
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

1130
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:49,937
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1131
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:51,666
And please hurry!

1132
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:55,810
What happened here?

1133
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:59,177
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1134
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:02,342
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

1135
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,914
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

1136
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,614
No one's flying the plane!

1137
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:10,887
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1138
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,292
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1139
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:15,557
Where's the pilot?

1140
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,122
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

1141
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,431
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

1142
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,130
As a matter of fact, there is.

1143
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,139
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

1144
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:27,505
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

1145
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:30,136
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1146
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,237
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1147
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:33,611
I can't fly a plane.

1148
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:36,014
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

1149
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,780
How hard could it be?

1150
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,817
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1151
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:48,920
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1152
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:51,830
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

1153
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,596
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

1154
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,830
That's Barry!

1155
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:59,396
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1156
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,705
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1157
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,835
Flowers?!

1158
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:07,007
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

1159
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,812
with absolutely no flight experience.

1160
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,319
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

1161
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:16,848
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

1162
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,893
They've done enough damage.

1163
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,485
But isn't he your only hope?

1164
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,360
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1165
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:25,366
Their wings are too small...

1166
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,800
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1167
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:31,237
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense. "

1168
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,638
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

1169
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,506
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

1170
01:13:36,445 --> 01:13:39,380
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

1171
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:42,508
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1172
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:44,711
But let me tell you about a small job.

1173
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,654
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

1174
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,658
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1175
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,218
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

1176
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:57,823
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

1177
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,731
We get behind a fellow.

1178
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,134
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

1179
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,598
Left, right, down, hover.

1180
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:09,234
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

1181
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,871
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1182
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,746
Barry, what happened?!

1183
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,754
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

1184
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,882
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

1185
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,552
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1186
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:33,597
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

1187
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,364
Move out!

1188
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:47,238
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

1189
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:48,340
Don't have to yell.

1190
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,942
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

1191
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,614
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1192
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,523
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1193
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,529
I can't do this!

1194
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:13,132
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

1195
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,568
You snap out of it.

1196
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:20,540
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1197
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,967
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1198
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,632
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.

1199
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,834
How is the plane flying?

1200
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,070
I don't know.

1201
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:50,936
Hello?

1202
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,005
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1203
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,515
The Pollen Jocks!

1204
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,211
They do get behind a fellow.

1205
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,720
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

1206
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,780
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

1207
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:05,349
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?

1208
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,725
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1209
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:10,026
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1210
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,191
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

1211
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:15,566
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1212
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:18,470
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1213
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,168
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1214
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,575
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1215
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:24,942
Bring the nose down.

1216
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:31,375
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1217
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:35,549
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

1218
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:39,492
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1219
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:41,893
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

1220
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:46,094
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

1221
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,192
Affirmative!

1222
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,663
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1223
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,402
Land on that flower!

1224
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:56,068
Ready? Full reverse!

1225
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,304
Spin it around!

1226
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,540
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

1227
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,984
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

1228
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:09,683
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

1229
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,591
made of millions of bees!

1230
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,653
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1231
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:17,992
Rotate around it.

1232
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:22,025
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

1233
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:26,131
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1234
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:29,609
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

1235
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:31,737
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1236
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:34,315
Aim for the center!

1237
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,352
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1238
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:49,290
Oome on, already.

1239
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:57,629
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1240
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:00,174
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

1241
01:18:00,242 --> 01:18:03,143
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1242
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:07,705
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

1243
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:10,308
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

1244
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,520
Listen, everyone!

1245
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:23,496
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1246
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,329
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1247
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,495
That means this is our last chance.

1248
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:34,167
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1249
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:38,804
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

1250
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,113
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?

1251
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,744
We're bees!

1252
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:46,981
Keychain!

1253
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:50,855
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1254
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,860
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1255
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:54,418
You've earned this.

1256
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,998
Yeah!

1257
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:10,768
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1258
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:15,878
Oh, yeah.

1259
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,181
That's our Barry.

1260
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,520
Mom! The bees are back!

1261
01:20:42,704 --> 01:20:45,172
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

1262
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:47,708
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

1263
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:07,151
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?

1264
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:11,996
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1265
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:16,401
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1266
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,370
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1267
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:21,704
I had no idea.

1268
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,244
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1269
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:27,509
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

1270
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:28,776
Sorry I'm late.

1271
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,976
He's a lawyer too?

1272
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:34,886
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

1273
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,787
Have a great afternoon!

1274
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:41,056
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

1275
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,495
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1276
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,363
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?

1277
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,562
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

1278
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,435
Thank you, Barry!

1279
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,475
That bee is living my life!

1280
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:57,670
Let it go, Kenny.

1281
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,340
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

1282
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,888
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

1283
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:12,723
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

1284
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:44,742
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

1285
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:46,609
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

1286
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:24,046
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

1287
01:30:24,118 --> 01:30:27,713
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?

1288
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,225
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

1289
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:34,386
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

1290
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:36,589
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
